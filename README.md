# Exploratory Data Analyis
## Assignment #1

###Introduction
These R scripts read from the data set *.txt
The first 3 scripts (plot 1-3.R) reproduce the first 3 single charts in the assignment
The 4th script reproduces 4 charts in a 2x2 appearance.

###Data
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
